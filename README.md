# phenotypic_variability
The data sets, R scripts for channel capacity calculations and R scripts for figure reproducing of a paper:

"Phenotypic variability, not noise, accounts for most of the cell-to-cell
heterogeneity of selected cytokine-induced JAK-STAT signaling responses", 
Topolewski et al. 2021

All required libraries are either at the beginning of scripts or in "Topolewski_auxiliary_functions.R" script. 
Loading of "Topolewski_auxiliary_functions.R" script is at the beginning of the plotting script if needed.

Each script is designed to be independent, that is no need for pre-running of any other scripts manually, all needed packages/functions are loaded together with the script execution.
