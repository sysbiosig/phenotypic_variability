Description of columns of data sets used in a paper:
"Phenotypic variability and not noise accounts for most of the cell-to-cell
heterogeneity in cytokine signaling", Topolewski et al. 2021

General columns occuring in multiple data sets:

- cell_type; either BJ or MEF
- replicate; the specific id of the replicate
- stim_type; either IFNG (mouse interferon gamma) or OSM (human oncostatin M)
- stim_level; a dose of the stimulation
- stim_unit; all doses are in ng/mL
- time; time since the beginning of cell stimulation to the cell fixation

Columns specific for:

# cytometry_paper.csv: data of pSTAT, STAT and receptor co-measurement on the flow cytometer
- FSC.A; area forward scatter 
- diameter; a diameter of a cell, calculated from the linear regression of size reference beads
- volume; volume of a cell calculated from the diameter assuming perfect roundness of a cell
- phospho_STAT; either phospho-STAT1 (for IFNG stim_type) or phospho-STAT3 (for OSM stim_type) signal
- total_STAT; either STAT1 (for IFNG stim_type) or STAT3 (for OSM stim_type) signal
- receptor; either IFNGR1 (for IFNG stim_type) or OSMR (for OSM stim_type) signal

# beads_paper.csv: data of size reference beads, used for linear regression to calculate the cell volume
- FSC.A; area forward scatter 
- sample_type; only one value "beads"
- diameter; a diameter of bead provided by the manufacturer, either 2, 4, 6, 10 or 15 um

# fused_paper.csv: response data of two nuclei of bi-nuclear syncytia
- ratio_dye_A; ratio of a dye A of both nuclei
- ratio_dye_B; ratio of a dye B of both nuclei
- merged_nuclei: either yes, if the nuclei are not assumed to be independent or not if opposite
- nuclearity: bi-nuclear, as the data come from bi-nuclear syncytia
- A; a response (pSTAT1 for IFNG and pSTAT3 for OSM) in the nucleus A
- B; a response (pSTAT1 for IFNG and pSTAT3 for OSM) in the nucleus B

# trajectories_paper.csv: response data of single-nuclear cells (no fusion performed) 
# and bi-nuclear syncytia, but with each nuclei treated separately
- merged_nuclei: either no, if the nuclei are assumed to be independent or NA if cell is single-nuclear
- nuclearity: bi-nuclear, as the data come from bi-nuclear syncytia
- response: a response (pSTAT1 for IFNG and pSTAT3 for OSM) in the nucleus
