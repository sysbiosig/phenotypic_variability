Description of columns of data sets used in a paper:
"Phenotypic variability and not noise accounts for most of the cell-to-cell
heterogeneity in cytokine signaling", Topolewski et al. 2021

General columns occuring in multiple data sets:

- cell_type; either BJ or MEF
- replicate; the specific id of the replicate
- stim_type; either IFNG (mouse interferon gamma) or OSM (human oncostatin M)
- stim_level; a dose of the stimulation
- stim_unit; all doses are in ng/mL
- time; time since the beginning of cell stimulation to the cell fixation

Columns specific for:

# fused_paper.csv: response data of two nuclei of bi-nuclear syncytia
- ratio_dye_A; ratio of a dye A of both nuclei
- ratio_dye_B; ratio of a dye B of both nuclei
- merged_nuclei: either yes, if the nuclei are not assumed to be independent or not if opposite
- nuclearity: bi-nuclear, as the data come from bi-nuclear syncytia
- A; a response (pSTAT1 for IFNG and pSTAT3 for OSM) in the nucleus A
- B; a response (pSTAT1 for IFNG and pSTAT3 for OSM) in the nucleus B

# trajectories_paper.csv: response data of single-nuclear cells (no fusion performed) 
# and bi-nuclear syncytia, but with each nuclei treated separately
- merged_nuclei: either no, if the nuclei are assumed to be independent or NA if cell is single-nuclear
- nuclearity: bi-nuclear, as the data come from bi-nuclear syncytia
- response: a response (pSTAT1 for IFNG and pSTAT3 for OSM) in the nucleus
